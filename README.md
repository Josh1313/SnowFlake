# Snowflake Warehouse Cheat Sheet

## Overview

This guide will help you get started quickly with Snowflake Warehouse by providing a cheat sheet for basic operations. It includes instructions on creating a table, checking its contents, loading data from an S3 bucket, and managing external stages.

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating the Table (Metadata Definition)

To create the `LOAN_PAYMENT` table, copy and run the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "OUR_FIRST_DB"."PUBLIC"."LOAN_PAYMENT" (
  "Loan_ID" STRING,
  "loan_status" STRING,
  "Principal" STRING,
  "terms" STRING,
  "effective_date" STRING,
  "due_date" STRING,
  "paid_off_time" STRING,
  "past_due_days" STRING,
  "age" STRING,
  "education" STRING,
  "Gender" STRING
);
```

---

### 2. Checking if the Table is Empty

Before loading data, ensure the table exists and is empty by running:

```sql
USE DATABASE OUR_FIRST_DB;

SELECT * FROM LOAN_PAYMENT;
```

---

### 3. Loading Data from an S3 Bucket

To load data from an S3 bucket into the `LOAN_PAYMENT` table, execute the following command:

```sql
COPY INTO LOAN_PAYMENT
    FROM s3://bucketsnowflakes3/Loan_payments_data.csv
    file_format = (type = csv
                   field_delimiter = ','
                   skip_header=1);
```

---

### 4. Validating the Data Load

After loading the data, confirm that it was inserted successfully by running:

```sql
SELECT * FROM LOAN_PAYMENT;
```

---

### 5. Managing External Stages

#### Creating a Database for Stage Management

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE MANAGE_DB;

CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA external_stages;
```

#### Creating an External Stage

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    url='s3://bucketsnowflakes3'
    credentials=(aws_key_id='ABCD_DUMMY_ID' aws_secret_key='1234abcd_key');
```

#### Describing the External Stage

```sql
DESC STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage;
```

#### Altering the External Stage

```sql
ALTER STAGE aws_stage
    SET credentials=(aws_key_id='XYZ_DUMMY_ID' aws_secret_key='987xyz');
```

#### Creating a Publicly Accessible Staging Area

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    url='s3://bucketsnowflakes3';
```

#### Listing Files in the Stage

```sql
LIST @aws_stage;
```

#### Loading Data Using COPY Command

```sql
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @aws_stage
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    pattern='.*Order.*';
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create tables, stages, and load data.
- Replace `s3://bucketsnowflakes3/Loan_payments_data.csv` and `s3://bucketsnowflakes3` with the correct S3 paths.
- Modify field types as necessary based on the actual data format.
